The Simple IoT project is a collection of IoT building blocks that includes:

- software (Portal/Edge)
- hardware
- firmware

Currently the Portal/Edge software is written in Go and Elm. The hardware and
firmware projects use Particle.io modules/firware.

The following scenarios may find this project useful.

1. You are developing a product and would like to give users access to data from
   the device remotely.
1. You need to restrict which users can see which devices.
1. Remote configuration or control of a device is needed.
1. You are developing an Embedded Linux project and need an application
   framework for implementing edge software.
1. You need software to manage a modem in an embedded Linux system.
1. You need a Go modbus package that implements both client and server
   functionality.
